# Hire Me -> Jarrett Cruger
I normally dislike these cover letter type ordeals but I'll give it a shot.

## Intro
So while attempting to absorb your codebases into my brain and contribute where
possible, I came across this repo. Because it was a clever idea, bringing the
job application process to the programmer's world, I decided to jump the
gun and apply here. I also decided to do this in more of a story format, so I hope you enjoy.

## Why hire me?
After discovering node.js a little over a year ago, it didn't take too many more
google searches before coming across you guys. I got my beta account and was
hooked from the beginning. Reducing the barrier for entry for new developers to
have a hosted web application is huge.

This was especially big for me at the time. A year ago for my last spring
semester I decided to create a course in order to teach myself node.js,
spine.js and MongoDB. The goal of this course was to create an
[application](#projects-pull-requests) in
order to help me better manage the work assignments at my fraternity. With the
application and technologies being an undertaking in themselves, hosting and
deploying the application was not something I had the brain capacity to worry
about. You guys were able to effectively supply the relief and helped me get an
A in the course.

That summer, instead of going the usual internship route, I had decided to venture
to Maryland to pursue an idea with a good friend of mine. Money wasn't really a
concern, what had intrigued me was the possibility to make change and to help
people secure their own data. It was also a prime opportunity to put my newly
grasped knowledge to good use

For the next 7 months I hammered javascript into my brain, spent time at an
"incubator", networked and ended up working in a basement office. Through this
process I was in charge of the technology stack. Coming from an express, mongoose
experience I initially fell into that same rhythm. That did not last as the
discovery of flatiron and the concept of streams started to hit me. With streams
churning through my brain, I was led to couchdb, the changes feed and the [nano][nano]
project. I was able to create a little emailer that listened on the changes feed
for our main site and felt I was on the right track.

Over this period of time I have learned invaluable lessons about both life and
technology but unfortunately, working solely on this project could not continue
financially. As I take more of a back seat to the rest of the process,
I continue to learn and see where I can apply my skills in a useful way.

So why am I telling you this story? Does any of this really bring anything to
the hiring equation? Well I suppose that is for you to decide. I wrote this
little excerpt to bring some context to who I am and what drives me. I am on
this earth to support a cause that brings positive change to the universe. Node showed me
that a full javascript stack will send us into the future, and you guys are the
facilitating factor. In order to ascend into the future of software,
we need to automate repetitive processes, make people believe in Open Source and
empower the web as a platform. You guys have already shown me that is a part of your plan. To say the
least, there are not many companies who offer free hosting for Open Source applications.

## Why am I awesome to work with?
* I believe in being the ultimate human collaborator.

    One of our greatest qualities as human beings is our ability to communicate
    and collaborate. Open Source and especially GitHub have made it possible to
    do this with software with people from across the globe. This is absolutely
    awesome. If someone needs another pair of eyes on a piece of code, I'm there.
    I always want to learn and help out where I can.

* I am not afraid to ask for help.

    When working on problems it is inevitable that road blocks will occur. Every
    fiber of your being wants to figure it out but you are usually too laser
    focused for that to be a productive use of time. The best bet is usually to
    walk away and maybe ask someone else for a little help.

* I am not afraid to express my opinion

    I understand that sometimes it is hard to express how you truly feel on
    a topic. There is a certain level of anxiety surrounding it and it has the
    chance of coming off as confrontational if there are others with differing
    opinions. I try and see past that and create an outlet where there can be
    objective discussion of a problem.

* I like to make people think differently

    In any group environment it is inevitable that a diverse set of perspectives
    will exist. I believe that there is great value in stepping outside of your
    own mind to try and see the world through another's eyes, and I have
    a tendency to initiate such exchanges.

* I enjoy a variety of activities

    I rock climb, ski, have philosophical conversations, play super smash brothers (original perferred)
    and I am always interested in trying something new.

* I actually care

    I have been told by people close to me that my ability to care is one of my
    redeeming qualities. While I would like to dismiss this type of statement,
    I am forced to agree. I care about technology, the future and empowering
    other people. I strive to empower myself in order to be able
    to help others empower themselves.

* I drink earl grey tea

    This reference was meant to project that I aspire to be a boss like Captain
    Picard in Star Trek: Next Generation.

## Projects & Pull Requests
Even though it is a hacked together mess written in CoffeeScript(*cringe*)
I am still quite proud of my [Community Management][OSCM] application.
The goal behind it was to have a slick web app for use at my Fraternity at RPI.
I was house manager at the time and we scheduled cleaning and various
assignments using an excel spreadsheet. As well as having hatred towards
microsoft, I found it tedious to use and inefficient. I envisioned it as an
intelligent automated process that could take user input into account (and of
course a web app). I was able to get pretty far in this endeavor and
I was quite proud.

When it comes to pull requests I am most proud of my contributions to
the [godot][godot] project. I am fascinated with its use of streams and it has
been very helpful in furthering my understanding of how they can be
implemented. I can only imagine how it can be used to architect a fully scalable
event processor that can spin off automated processes to fix a possible issue.
I am very interested in being a part of its evolution as I continue to learn
more.
